  "Most RV sinks have covers that slide over top while youâ€™re driving down the road. These covers are great because they not only create a covered in-sink storage area, but they also serve as extra counter space. But what if we took that concept one step farther? What if, in addition to a storage lid and extra space, the sink covers also doubled as cutting boards? Brilliant right! This simple DIY requires nothing more than a simple cutting board and a hack saw to cut it to size. For more instructions take a look at this article on rvtravel.com.";
